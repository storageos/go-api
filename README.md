# OpenAPI manifests generator for GO

[![GO get and vet](https://github.com/storageos/go-api/actions/workflows/basic-checks.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/storageos/go-api/actions/workflows/basic-checks.yml)

Repo used for storage and generating the GO structs and variables from an OpenAPI yaml spec file (generated by Openapi Generator https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator).

Because we only ever reference **object types** we don't need the OpenAPI generator to create a full fledged GO Client for us and as such we delete the go.mod this tool generates resulting in a single GO Module under this directory.
